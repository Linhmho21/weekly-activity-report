### Big Three

- Developing ML metrics (https://jira.supermicro0.opswerx.org/browse/DS-21 "Week 2: Weekly Report")

- Time Series research and possible approaches (https://jira.supermicro0.opswerx.org/browse/DS-12 
"GAD project data exploration")

- Based on research and data exploration, team decided to pursue the multivariate cross-correlation approach.

### Objective

The over-arching objective is to develop a machine learning tool that can flag jamming/spoofing activity. 
We are focusing on conducting further research into the multivariate cross-correlation approach; if, after testing,
it is deemed to be an appropriate approach, we will determine how to incorporate automation via a ML tool.

### Work I Did

Continued reading materials provided by Tracey and John to better understand relationships between variables and
possible approaches to determine jamming activities. 


### Meetings
  - Conference call @ 1300 EST on 1/18/19; Christina, Hao, and John attended. We discussed next steps to take after everyone had time to 
  evaulate the data during week 1.  We will schedule another conference call next week when our two new team members, Supriya and Shuang,
  are ready to work on this project.  

### Summary/Remarks:

- Evaluated data and researched protocols, ultimately deciding to go with the cross-correlation approach

- Not all interference is due to jamming - and these false positives can significantly skew data

- Developed metrics to determine certain behaviors


### Follow up

- Need to conduct research to identify how to use the cross-correlaton approach in this project.
- Assign tasks to additional team members, such as, testing mining features, evaluating metrics, etc.
