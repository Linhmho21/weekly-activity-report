- Began looking into creating a general program which would utilized trained models for live RF scanning.

### Objective
Develop or implement a technology which scans and classifies radio frequencies depending on the patterns and characteristics of the signal passed through them.

### Work I Did
Test out new dataset incorporation, reintroduce new team goal of creating a way of utilizing the generated model, begin looking into creating a way of programming a generated model with live RF scanning, and continue reformatting data and training algorithm.
