### Big Three
- Began development of a Decision Tree Classifier algorithmn after seeing 86% accuracy scores through Weka trials
- Ran initial ML algorithmns through Weka to determine best path to move forward
- Finished Annotation Script add-on and sampling function for Pysqlite code

### Objective
Complete data pre-processing for entire GAD and begin data modelling process

### Work I Did
Completed annotation of the Torgi Jammed file through usage of pandas as well as created a basae sample for replication by others. Began initail tests with Weka 
to determine best algorithmns to follow through with. After seeing 86% accuracy on decision tree model in weka began process of replicating that perfomance through custom
python code.

### Meetings
 - Weekly Friday Review meeting with David

### Follow up
- Continue the 2nd Algorithmn iteration modeling
