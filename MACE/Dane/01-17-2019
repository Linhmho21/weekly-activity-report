### Work I Did

I setup all of my accounts.

I began setup of tensorflow on Jupyter.

I met my team.

### Meetings

I met with David to go over project assignments.

### Summary/Remarks:

- Worked to get all of my accounts setup, and familiarize myself with all the tools we have here.

- I learned about Jira, Jupyter, Tensorflow, Computer Vision, and I met most of my teammates.

- I am starting to figure out how to use Jupyter.


### Follow up

- I want to figure out what computer vision model I should use.

- I want a plan for how to build an image dataset to train the machine learning model.
