- Began working on reading RF signals using the SDR and Raspberry Pi

- Completed "first week" tasks such as populating the calender and getting set up on Jira

### Objective

Be able to detect RF devices and idetify them using a data base of various RF devices, categorized using their specific RF attributes. 

### Work I Did

- Researched/got familiar with GitHub, Jira, and Wireshark.
- Researched various RF devices and platforms to gather information about their RF characteristics.
- Set up SD card for the Raspberry Pi with Raspbian

### Meetings

### Summary/Remarks:

- Most of this weeks activities have been based around getting introduced to the project and the various aspects of it. 

- I have learned a lot about the Wirehark software which is essential to the RF portion of the project. Also, the general set up of both Jira and GitHub. 

- Began working on the test plan document and setting up the Raspberry Pi to read RF signals. 


### Follow up

- More research on Wireshark using the Raspberry Pi
- Set up Pi to readd RF signals using SDR
