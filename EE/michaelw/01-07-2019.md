### Big Three

- Read documentation on Space Coast Unmanned drone

- Proposed a modeling solution and possible lag compensator

- Researched sensor to identify illumination source (unrelated to drone project)

### Objective

Read through drone documentation to understand system process.

### Work I Did

Asked David for documents on Drone. Received brief on latency issue. Found modelling process and potential PD controllers for a drone in matlab and simulink.


### Meetings
  - SOFWERX Stand Up: Brief overview of current projects and introduced the new interns.

### Summary/Remarks:

- Need more information to determine how to proceed with solving lag issues

- Gained knowledge on interfacing an xbox controller with drone

- rough outline on how to beginning modelling the system


### Follow up

- Consult with Mujahid and/or Brian on solving lag issues
- Contact other EE interns for a collaboration effort.
