### Big Three

- Submitted research on SWIR illumination source (unrelated to drone project)

- researched complimentary filter for potential lag fix

- Created guide to organize work needed to be done on drone

### Objective

Organize the work needed to be done on drone and run bootup sequence on company laptop.

### Work I Did

Created group on office 365 to upload documents related to drone project. Outlined notes from meeting with Mujahid and David A. Downloaded Arduino software to analyze current controller.


### Meetings

  - David A. and Mujahid gave me a rundown of how to test current drone and where in the code to place a better controller


### Summary/Remarks:

- Found out python on company laptop was 32-bit not 64-bit, and solving this issue allowed the code to successfully interface controller with drone

- Believe the oscillations in initial bootup are from the gimbal resting on the table and not being in flight with the drone


### Follow up

- Consult with Mujahid on constructing proportional controller
- Do formal testing with Jesse to measure lag
