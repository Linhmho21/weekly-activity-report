### Work I Did
   This week, I began work on the Fam Cart's manual. Since the initial design has not been completed, I merged together the three existing
   manuals. In addition, I took pictures and talked to the foundry engineers to figure out what the user needs from the new manual. I helped
   Megan create a scheduling guide for the interns, and also began work on the K9 ISR project. I tracked down the Raspberry pi camera
   and began to program it to work with the existing Pi.
