### Big Three

- Worked on identifying correlation of TORGI data.

- Worked to determine useful way to visualize TORGI data

- Worked on locating patterns that identify GPS jamming in TORGI data.

### Objective

This weeks objective is to extract useful and meaningful data markers from TORGI data that can identify when GPS signals are being jammed.  In addition, we are trying to determine how jamming affects the positioning signal.

### Work I Did

Discussed with Fletcher how to display TORGI data.  Once we identified the useful data points, the challenge became how to display the data to identify jamming markers.

### Meetings
  - NSR

### Summary/Remarks:

- Some of the issues we are running into with the TORGI data are:
  - Not all positioning signals (GPS/GLONASS) are affected by same jamming signal.
  - Jamming can affect positioning signals from similar sources in different ways.
  - Positioning signal is not continuous from one source.

### Follow up

- Will continue to clean up TORGI data to determine what relevant information can be extrapolated. New markers need to be identified in the TORGI to simplify data analysis.
