### Big Three

- Edited the heo-docs README to include useful links to other repositories

- Researched OpenSensorHub, WMS, and Geopackage

- Started working on a program that will send and receive requests to a Geopackage server

### Objective

Familiarize myself with MWS and Geopackage; develop a program that will communicate with and download geopackages from a geopackage server.

### Work I Did

I wrote Python in jupyter to get used to jupyter notebooks and docker environments, and I read documentation on WMS service requests and Geopackage to get started on writing a program that requests geopackages.
