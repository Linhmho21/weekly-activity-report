### Big Three

- Accomplished a Windows build along with successfully cloning a Skull Nuc without any help.

- Successfully installed an OVRC Hub in the server room.  
- Aided other interns with setting up their calendars. 

### Objective

This week, I continued to learn about the different responsibilities of a System Adminstrator. There was more of an emphasis on recalling certain information as well as completing tasks without any help. I also learned more about the process of creating assets in Snipe IT, the purpose of OVRC Hubs, and the usefulness of Jira.

### Work I Did

- I revised and followed the documentation provided in the SWX_Docs OneDrive group when necessary
- I learned new Linux commands that aided in troubleshooting Clonezilla
- Installed OVRC Hub in Snipe IT
- Completed Windows build
- Found partial solution for organizing the supply closet for the Nerd Herd
- Helped interns set up calendars


### Meetings
  - SWX Stand Up - All Hands

### Summary/Remarks:

I'm continuing to learn about the different practices and procedures at SOFWERX. I have gained more knowledge about Snipe IT, Jira, OVRC, and SAVI. I have began to work on receiving less help and accomplishing more tasks independently. 

### Follow up

 I need to develop a stronger solution to organizing the supply closet for the Nerd Herd.
